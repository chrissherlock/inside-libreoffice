# Inside LibreOffice

LibreOffice has been around, in one form or another, since the late 80s/early 90s. In 1988 Marco BÃ¶rries wrote StarWriter for the Zilog Z80, then the next year formed the German company Star Division. Star Division eventually fleshed out their offering and renamed it to Star Office. At some point Star Division also marketed and sold a cross platform C++ framework they called StarView. This, [they claimed](http://www.trumphurst.com/cpplibs/datapage.php?frompage=navbar&sqldata=Category%3D%27Mcom2%27), was part of a larger framework they called SOLAR (which you can still see in several of the classes e.g. SolarMutex). In fact, StarView was in essence what we now call the Visual Components Library (VCL) and contained much the same [class structure](http://collaboration.cmc.ec.gc.ca/science/rpn/biblio/ddj/Website/articles/DDJ/1993/9312/9312h/9312h.htm) we still use today.

Sun Microsystems later bought Star Division and opened the Star Office code to the general public under their license, the CDDL. Star Office was renamed to OpenOffice.org. Whilst code was contributed by third parties, it became increasingly bureaucratic and frustrating. Sun took a long time to merge patches, so Ximian resorted to a fork that incorporated many changes, which was increasingly used by Linux distributions. When Sun was bought by Oracle, relationships with many of the developers outside of Oracle became increasingly strained. This reached a head in late September 2010 when a group of developers forked OpenOffice.org to LibreOffice under the stewardship of a new organization, [The Document Foundation](https://www.documentfoundation.org).
