# Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

Most modern operating systems have designed processes such that they are protected from other operating system processes, a concept called _process isolation_. This is done for stability and security reasons, however it may be necessary for one process to communicate with another process, and a variety of mechanisms have been developed to allow for this. The concept of processes communicating with each other is referred to as _Inter-Process Communication_, or more commonly abbreviated to _IPC_.

Most operating systems implement IPC, albeit with subtle differences, via signals, sockets, message queues, pipes (named and anonymous), shared memory and memory-mapped files. As a cross-platform product, LibreOffice attempts to unify each operating system's IPC functionality via the OSL API.
